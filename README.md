# Data-Visualisation--Haberman-cancer-dataset

This is my first Kaggle project and I am excited to share my exploratory analysis here with everyone.

## Summary on dataset 
-The [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/krpiku/haberman.csv) contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.

-In this dataset, we observed 4 main columns:
  - Age: Age of patients (30 years old - 78 years old)
  - Year: Year 1958 to 1969
  - Nodes: Number of positive axillary nodes 
  - Status: 1 for survived and 2 for dead

## Tasks for this study
- To find out any correlation between survival rate and age
- Did the cancer patients have better survival chance as the year progresses?
- Did the number of positive axillary nodes affect survival rates?
